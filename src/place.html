        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The Axum Tsion church is situated close to the grounds of the <br> Obelisks of Axum in the town of Axum, Tigray Region, <br>northern Ethiopia. The first church is thought to have been <br>erected in the fourth century AD during the reign of Ezana,<br> the first Christian king of the Kingdom of Axum <br>(current-day Eritrea and Ethiopia), and has subsequently been <br>restored multiple times. As a result, women are not allowed into the<br> "Old Church" due to the reservation that the Blessed Virgin Mary, <br>who symbolizes the Ark, is the only woman permitted inside its grounds.</p>

                <p>A group of people called the Hamar live in southwest Ethiopia. <br>    In the Debub Omo Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities,<br> and Peoples Region, in the Hamer woreda (or district),<br> a fertile area of the Omo River valley, they reside (SNNPR). <br>Most of them are pastoralists.

                    The Hamar are renowned for their distinctive <br>"bull jumping" tradition, which marks a boy's transition into manhood. <br>First, female relatives dance and invite newly initiated males to whip them; <br>this demonstrates their support for the initiate and their scars give them <br>the power to choose who they marry.</p>
